 * 1. Social viscosity measures the evolution of where I am in contrast to where
 * I want to be in relation to all my interactants
 *
 * 2.Social viscosity measures the contrast between where I am and where I want
 * to be in relation to all my interactants over a period of time (the execution
 * of a task or practice)

 * Santa Marta, June 2019
 * 3. Social viscosity is estimated by contrasting "where I am" with "where I intend
 * to be" in relation to all my interactants over the execution of a task or practice.
 *
 * The same could also be reframed:
 * 4. The viscosity of a social practice is estimated by contrasting where
 * agents "intended to be" with where they "ended" after the execution of social actions.
 * The meaning of "where" includes the interactions with all their interactants
 * and the world.

// For each agent i in current time
// Iterate over its interactants j at the previous time step
// Take the intendend distances to each j
// Take the current distance to each j
// Calculate, timetag and store the difference
// Calculate and store the average for this round
